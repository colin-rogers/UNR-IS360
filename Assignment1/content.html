            <h2>School</h2>
            <p>
                I first began my journey as a student at UNR, in Fall 2018, as a Computer Science major.
                During my time as a CS major I worked my hardest on my <em>C</em> and <em>C++</em>
                programming assignments, but I couldn't pass my exams. What was really disheartening was
                the two "weed-out" classes (CS 135 and 202) have criteria stating that (1) You have to pass
                the class with at least a C in the class, and (2) You need a C average on both your exams
                <em>and</em> your programming assignments. This meant that even though I got perfect scores
                on my assignments, I wasn't able to move to the next class because my exam grades weren't
                good enough. During my time in CS, I also pursed the major's Digital and Interactive Games
                minor with some friends, here we were able to make a couple prototype games of our very own!
            </p>
            <p>
                After I spent my first two years stumbling through my CS classes, I decided in the Summer of
                2020, that I needed to find somewhere else to direct my focus, because something clearly
                wasn't clicking with CS. So I talked to my advisor and he directed me to the College of
                Business' Information Systems major. Switching colleges seemed like a daunting task,
                especially with the amount of Pre-Business courses required like accounting, marketing,
                economics, etc. But I powered through, taking 15 credits every semester, as well as Winter
                and Summer sessions, ultimately only tacking on an extra semester to my original four year
                time frame. It is here where I plan to finally graduate in December 2022 with my Bachelor's
                Degree.

            <h2>Career Interests</h2>
            <p>
                For the last year, I have been a student employee in the university's Information Security
                department, working as a Junior Security Analyst. As part of this position, I am expected to
                monitor the school's abuse inbox (abuse@unr.edu) and determine if submitted emails are a
                phishing attempt, spam, malware, or simply a false positive. Once I make this determination,
                I then make a ticket within our TeamDynamix environment, which is also forwarded to the
                university's OIT department. Another job of mine is to monitor our instance of Azure Sentinel,
                which receives alerts for a variety of things such as: password spray attacks from certain
                networks, atypical travel for a given user(s), or potential compromised user account.
            </p>
            <p>
                As for where I see myself working after graduating, I'm not quite sure. I'm confident that I'd
                like to work somewhere in the IT field, but I haven't quite made up my mind what that means
                for me. In a perfect world where money wasn't a concern, I would be totally content working
                just a baseline IT job, fixing and troubleshooting people's issues. While this isn't exactly
                exciting, I'm the kind of person that could spend hours just sitting at my desk working on
                a puzzel or some other tedious task. I really enjoy problem solving, in general, and the
                satisfaction of finally figuring out what's wrong is like none other. Before getting my job
                in the InfoSec office, I had also applied to the Genious Bar at the Apple Store, because
                I thought that this could be a great opportunity to do what I love, while also helping
                strengthen my social skills; as a quite introverted person, I felt this aspect being crucial.
                Speaking more realistically now, I can likely see myself working as a data analyst, which
                still has that problem solving element when it comes to translating the desires of clients,
                into a useable database.
            </p>
            <p>
                I already have some connections with people working at Sierra Nevada Corporation, and CustomInk,
                so post-graduation, so hopefully I'll be able to use this network to get my foot in the door to my
                adult career.

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>
                With how busy I am this semester with school (~10 hour days, Mon-Thurs), my mental battery is
                just about drained by the time I get home. So during most of my free time during the week, or
                on the weekends, you'll usually find my hanging out in my room, sitting in front of my computer,
                in a hoodie and a pair of old gym shorts. Whether this means a long gaming session with some of
                my buddies, or I'playing around with Adobe's <em>Premiere Pro</em> or <em>Photoshop</em>, at home,
                in front of my setup, is where I get recharge and relax. I also got a guitar from a friend that
                was moving away at the beginning of the year and ever since, its just been sititng in the corner
                of my room, so soon I'm hoping to start teaching myself how to play that as well!

            <h3>Gaming</h3>
            <p>
                Right now, the games that have most of my attention are <em>Destiny 2</em>, <em>New World</em>,
                and soon <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warefare II</em> (not <em>Modern Warfare 2</em> that came out in
                2009, the new one that's releasing in October, confusing I know). I'd like to take some time to
                discuss Destiny, a game that's had its hold on me, and many others since my freshman year of high
                school. Picture this, its Spring 2014, and you just here about a new shooter from Bungie, the original
                creators of the <em>Halo</em> franchise, where you get to travel the solar system and beyond, and
                defeat different enemy alien races using space magic. Fast forward to Fall 2014, not only was it
                the Tuesday following the first day of high school, but it was also the morning after going to
                Gamestop, for the midnight release of Destiny,. It was from then onward, where my life would never
                be the same. With each year following, a new expansion would release and the excitement hasn't
                diminished. But beyond just the fun that I've had playing this game, I have met some of the
                greatest people from this community, people that I can call friends, and even will consistently
                meet and play board game with them once or twice a month.

            <h3>Video Production</h3>
            <p>
                My passion for video production has also been close to my heart since the early days of high
                school. Whether it was making a broadcast news package, a commercial, or a short film, I was
                always the one to volunteer to edit it. I don't know why I was so enthusiastic about it,
                but it was always really fun to start with just the raw footage that we compiled over the course
                of the last day, week, or month, and assemble it together into one coherent package. Since high
                school, I've been trying to find ways to continue this passion of mine, and this is when the idea
                of making YouTube videos seemed like a place to focus this energy. So I made a subscription to
                Adobe's Creative Cloud service, and downloaded <em>Premiere Pro</em>, the video editing software
                that we used in high school. But because I obviously didn't have a film crew to work with, I
                decided to turn to my other vise, gaming, and combine the two worlds. So I started to record some
                funny moments or cool things that happened in games, and edit those together, and put them to music.
                I had a lot of fun with this, but those videos didn't really go anywhere because YouTube doesn't
                really like when you upload videos of copyrighted music. I hope to be able to pursue these creative
                endeavours again some day, maybe after graduating when I have more time on my hands. I've have
                embedded my most recent project (from over a year ago at this point) <a href="https://youtu.be/g-n8VJ0-ozk" target="_blank">HERE</a>, 
                and linked the first video I made using Destiny clips <a href="https://youtu.be/g-n8VJ0-ozk" target="_blank">HERE</a>!
