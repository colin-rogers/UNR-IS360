            <h1>School</h1>
            <p>
                I first began my journey as a student at UNR, in Fall 2018, as a Computer Science major. 
                During my time as a CS major I worked my hardest on my <em>C</em> and <em>C++</em> 
                programming assignments, but I couldn't pass my exams. What was really disheartening was
                the two "weed-out" classes (CS 135 and 202) have criteria stating that (1) You have to pass
                the class with at least a C in the class, and (2) You need a C average on both your exams
                <em>and</em> your programming assignments. This meant that even though I got perfect scores
                on my assignments, I wasn't able to move to the next class because my exam grades weren't
                good enough. During my time in CS, I also pursed the major's Digital and Interactive Games
                minor with some friends, here we were able to make a couple prototype games of our very own!
            </p>
            <p>
                After I spent my first two years stumbling through my CS classes, I decided in the Summer of
                2020, that I needed to find somewhere else to direct my focus, because something clearly
                wasn't clicking with CS. So I talked to my advisor and he directed me to the College of
                Business' Information Systems major. Switching colleges seemed like a daunting task,
                especially with the amount of Pre-Business courses required like accounting, marketing,
                economics, etc. But I powered through, taking 15 credits every semester, as well as Winter
                and Summer sessions, ultimately only tacking on an extra semester to my original four year
                time frame. It is here where I plan to finally graduate in December 2022 with my Bachelor's 
                Degree.
